# Graphite
The Graphite Library is part of _The Diamond Project_ and aims to provide modern, cross platform implementations of various features 
and aspects of functionality from the Classic Macintosh OS and Carbon Frameworks.

## Using libGraphite
TBC

## libTesting
The Graphite library includes a secondary library designed for providing the required functionality for basic unit testing. You can find documentation for this in the `libTesting` directory. Graphite uses this library to test the core functionality and performance of main `libGraphite` library, along with CMake and GitHub Actions to ensure that no regressions occur and that all added functionality is actually correct and verified.

It is provided in such a way that you can use it in your own projects should you wish to.
